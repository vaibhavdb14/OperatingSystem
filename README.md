## 🛠️ Requirements and Setup

To run and test these programs, you typically need the following:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Most modern OS and System Programming simulations are often implemented in Java, C, or C++.
* **A suitable compiler/interpreter:** (e.g., `javac`/`java` for Java, `gcc` for C/C++).
* **IDE (Optional):** An Integrated Development Environment like VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.

### How to Run:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a Program:**
    ```bash
    cd Memory-Allocation-Algos 
    ```
3.  **Compile and Run:** (Example for a Java file named `FirstFit.java`)
    ```bash
    javac FirstFit.java
    java FirstFit
    ```
